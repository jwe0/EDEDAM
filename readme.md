## Encoders

### Base64
Encode text with the Ascii Table
```
python3 Base64.py --mode encode --input Test
```

### Rot
Also known as Caesar cipher named after Julius Caesar. Rot shifts the letter to a different letter based on a shift value like 13. For example in rot13 a becomes n.
```
python3 Rot.py --mode encode --string Test --shift 13
```


## Sorting Algorithms

### Selection
Selection sort iterates through a list and checks if the number is larger than the previous number and if it is then it appends to a new array and removes that number from the original array. Selection sort continues until the list is completly sorted
```
# Open the file and input an array
```
